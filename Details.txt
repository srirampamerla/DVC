Git cannot access the 100GBPS of data directly. With the help of DVC we will keep track to store

DVC wil only be used for tracking the data files,right. GIT specifically used for track the entire other code information ansd whatever
configuration file required for th DVC

DVC init will initialize the DVC

git init

pip install dvc 

dvc init

git status -- automatically dvc files got committed.


git commit -m " "

dvc add data/data.txt  - the file tracked by dvc not git. .gitignore is created to ignore the data.txt file due to dvc is tracking 
no need to track by git.
data\data.txt.dvc will be the hash value which map with the data
## This is the first version-- hash d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e. Based on the hash key file is created to located.

git can track only data\.gitignore,data\data.txt.dvc


git add data/data.txt.dvc
git add data/.gitignore

add second line in the data evry time u run dvc add data/data.txt it will new hash key. In hash key the data will seen

git add data/data.txt.dvc
git add data/.gitignore

git commit -m ""
git log

git checkout 560196f61dd0be8fbc8fbdf91ba0a17de1499e52

dvc checkout will give which file the changes happened in the commit. that file will give
